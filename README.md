Go package for mapping values to and from space-filling curves, such as
[Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) and [Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve) curves.

## How to use

Install:

```bash
go get github.com/google/hilbert
```

Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/dsoprea/hilbert"
)

func main() {
    // Create a Hilbert curve for mapping to and from a 16 by 16 space.
    //s, err := hilbert.NewHilbert64(16)
    s, err := hilbert.NewHilbert(16)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Create a Peano curve for mapping to and from a 27 by 27 space.
    //s, err := hilbert.NewPeano64(27)
    //s, err := hilbert.NewPeano(27)

    t := 112

    // Now map one dimension numbers in the range [0, N*N-1], to an x,y
    // coordinate on the curve where both x and y are in the range [0, N-1].
    x, y, err := s.Map(t)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // (x, y) <= (7, 11)

    // Also map back from (x,y) to t.
    t, err = s.MapInverse(x, y)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

## Demo

The demo directory contains an example on how to draw an images of Hilbert and Peano curves, as well
as animations of varying sizes for both.

```bash
go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/hilbert/demo/demo.go
```

and the following images are generated. 

Simple 8x8 Hibert curve:

Simple 9x9 Peano curve:
